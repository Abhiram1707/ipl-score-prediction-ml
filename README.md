This project uses machine learning techniques to predict IPL match scores by analyzing team performance, player stats, and match conditions. Ideal for cricket enthusiasts and data science learners.

This project focuses on predicting the final score of an Indian Premier League (IPL) match using machine learning techniques. Given the popularity of cricket and the vast amount of historical match data available, the aim is to analyze key features such as team names, overs played, current score, wickets lost, and player performance to estimate the final score of an innings.

The dataset is preprocessed to handle categorical features like team names, venue, and innings. Several regression algorithms were trained and evaluated to identify the best-performing model in terms of prediction accuracy. Models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree Regressor were compared based on performance metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and RÂ² score.

This project is ideal for cricket enthusiasts, data science beginners, and students who want to explore practical applications of machine learning in sports analytics. It demonstrates how to clean and transform sports data, train predictive models, and visualize results effectively using Python libraries like pandas, sklearn, and matplotlib.
